			Hi! I'm Jen Lam, a penultimate Commerce & Information Systems student based in Sydney. I aim to design for people through creating engaging digital products and experiences that will positively impact their daily lives.<p>
			<b>Technology meets design</b>
			Growing up, I was always interested in two things - technology and design. While it was never my first career choice, I came to enjoy both as hobbies. 
			My design journey began in 2009, creating the front cover of my primary school's information booklet for newcomers. I then became a member of the yearbook publication team in high school, being part of a wonderful committee of 20 people for 5 years. 
			As a hobby, I experimented and designed an assortment of graphics using Photoshop. Since then, I have been using Illustrator, Premiere Elements and XD in a variety of university and side projects.
