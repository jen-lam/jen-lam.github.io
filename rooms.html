      <b>Problem</b><br>
        During breaks, many students visit the library for an undisrupted place to study, hold groups meetings or interviews. As a result, some students book rooms or media booths days in advance. The booking system, however, causes an underutilisation of rooms and media booths, and does not accommodate students with unscheduled breaks or meetings. Thus, these students find themselves walking around each level looking for an appropriate space, which can be quite time consuming.
      <p>
      <b>Challenge</b><br>
        How might we create a simple and efficient booking system for students that will improve the utilisation of time and study spaces?
      <p>
      <b>Solution</b><br>
        UNSW Rooms is a mobile application that allows students to quickly search, filter and view rooms and media booths that better align with their needs. Students are also able to share larger capacity rooms with other students, to improve utilisation.
