      <h2>Problem</h2>
        During breaks, many students visit the library for an undisrupted place to study, hold groups meetings or interviews. As a result, some students book rooms or media booths days in advance. The booking system, however, causes an underutilisation of rooms and media booths, and does not accommodate students with unscheduled breaks or meetings. Thus, these students find themselves walking around each level looking for an appropriate space, which can be quite time consuming.
      <p>

      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        How might we create a simple and efficient booking system for students that will improve the utilisation of time and study spaces?
        <p>
      </div>

      	<section>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
        UNSW Rooms is a mobile application that allows students to quickly search, filter and view rooms and media booths that better align with their needs. Students are also able to share larger capacity rooms with other students, to improve utilisation.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <b>Student Insights</b><br>
      As a student who has both booked rooms in the past, as well as walked around tirelessly looking for a vacant room, I used my own experience as a guide for user interviews to develop insights into the room booking experience. After interviewing multiple students from different stages and faculties, I collated the information to derive the following insights:

      <ul>
      	<li>Students whose lectures and tutorials that are typically at lower campus feel less inclined to study or hold meetings in the library (upper campus) – these students either did not know of the booking system or have rarely used it</li>
      	<li>Students have found that rooms that could seat 4 or more people are rarely ever at full capacity</li>
      	<li>Some students have spent more than 20 minutes trying to find a vacant room on multiple occasions</li>
      	<li>Many students hope to find a vacant room without having to book one</li>
      	<li>Students were willing to share greater capacity rooms with other students as long as they are not disruptive</li>
      </ul>

			<p><br><p>
				Based on the student insights, two customer journey maps were made to represent the student's actions, feelings, and opportunities for improvement. The journey maps were based on two personas:
				<ul>
					<li>Jessica Pham - a first year Information Systems student who has never booked a room before</li>
					<li>Natalie Oh - a third year Civil Engineering student who has booked multiple rooms before</li>
				</ul>

		<b>Current System</b><br>
		To further understand the room booking experience, I analysed the current system and identified possible problem areas and developed potential solutions to combat these problems.

	var slideIndex = 1;
showSlides(slideIndex);

// Next/previous controls
function plusSlides(n) {
  showSlides(slideIndex += n);
}

// Thumbnail image controls
function currentSlide(n) {
  showSlides(slideIndex = n);
}

function showSlides(n) {
  var i;
  var slides = document.getElementsByClassName("mySlides");
  var dots = document.getElementsByClassName("dot");
  if (n > slides.length) {slideIndex = 1} 
  if (n < 1) {slideIndex = slides.length}
  for (i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) {
      slides[i].style.display = "none"; 
  }
  for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) {
      dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(" active", "");
  }
  slides[slideIndex-1].style.display = "block"; 
  dots[slideIndex-1].className += " active";
