    			<b>Background</b><br>
    			For a business analysis course, we were tasked with improving the Huli information system and mobile application used by the government-run Karnataka Forest Deparment.<p>
    			<b>Team:</b> Irene D., Shitang J., Jen L., Ryan L., Nicholas T.<br>
    			<b>Role:</b> Ideation, Prototyping<br><b>Duration:</b> August - October 2018</p>

    		<h2>Problem</h2>
    		The current system lacks integrated business processes, has inefficient data recording and sharing methods, and does not provide meaningful insights and engagement, all of which hinder the efforts towards conserving the forests of Karnataka, India.<p><br>

    		<h2>Challenge</h2>
    		How might we incorporate recent technologies and develop value-creating features for the Huli system to assist forest guards in the conservation of forests?<p><br>

    		<h2>Solution</h2>
    		<b>1. Interface redesign</b><br>
    		Through redesigning the mobile interface, forest guards are likely to find it easier and quicker to input more accurate data that will be useful to the wildlife conservation deparment.<p>
    		<b>2. Analytics</b><br>
    		A simple, interactive dashboard that allows forest guards to view their sightings history and progress to increase motivation.<p>
    		<b>3. Integration of instant messaging</b><br>
    		By integrating a messaging feature in the current mobile application, forest guards are able to access and discuss reports more readily.

			<h2>Implementation Approach</h2>
			To properly approach this project, we first had to decide which project implementation approach we would take. After reading through the project scenario, we decided our approach according to the following:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Clarity of user requirements:</b> High - based on the project scenario, we knew the users and processes in details</li>
				<li><b>Familiarity with technology:</b> Medium - while we had screenshots of the current mobile application, we were unable to interact with the actual application</li>
				<li><b>System complexity:</b> Low - the mobile application served a limited amount of processes</li>
				<li><b>System reliability:</b> Medium - should be accurate and expedient but does not need constant uptime</li>
				<li><b>Short-time schedules:</b> High - we had approximately 10 weeks to complete the project proposal</li>
				<li><b>Schedule visibility:</b> High - as a government department system, required transparency in documentation</li>

			</ul>
