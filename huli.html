			<h2>Project Background</h2>
    		For a business analysis course, we were tasked with improving the Huli information system and mobile application used by the government-run Karnataka Forest Deparment.<p>
    		<b>Team:</b> Irene D., Shitang J., Jen L., Ryan L., Nicholas T.<br>
    		<b>Role:</b> Research, Ideation, Design, Prototyping<br><b>Duration:</b> August - October 2018</p>
		</section>

    	<section>
    		<div class="background">
	    		<div class="col" style="margin-right:120px">
		    		<h3>Problem</h3>
		    		The current system lacks integrated business processes, has inefficient data recording and sharing methods, and does not provide meaningful insights and engagement, all of which hinder the efforts towards conserving the forests of Karnataka, India.
	    		</div>

	    		<div class="col">
		    		<h3>Challenge</h3>
		    		How might we incorporate recent technologies and develop value-creating features for the Huli system to assist forest guards in the conservation of forests?
	    		</div>
    		</div>


		    	<h2>Solution</h2>
		    	<h3>1. Interface redesign</h3>
		    	Through redesigning the mobile interface, forest guards are likely to find it easier and quicker to input more accurate data that will be useful to the wildlife conservation deparment.<p>
		    	<h3>2. Analytics</h3>
		    	A simple, interactive dashboard that allows forest guards to view their sightings history and progress to increase motivation.<p>
		    	<h3>3. Integration of instant messaging</h3>
		    	By integrating a messaging feature in the current mobile application, forest guards are able to access and discuss reports more readily.

			<h2>Implementation Approach</h2>

			To properly approach this project, we first had to decide which project implementation approach we would take. After reading through the project scenario, we decided our approach according to the following:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Clarity of user requirements:</b> High - based on the project scenario, we knew the users and processes in details</li>
				<li><b>Familiarity with technology:</b> Medium - while we had screenshots of the current mobile application, we were unable to interact with the actual application</li>
				<li><b>System complexity:</b> Low - the mobile application served a limited amount of processes</li>
				<li><b>System reliability:</b> Medium - should be accurate and expedient but does not need constant uptime</li>
				<li><b>Short-time schedules:</b> High - we had approximately 10 weeks to complete the project proposal</li>
				<li><b>Schedule visibility:</b> High - as a government department system, required transparency in documentation</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			We examined three approaches - Unified Process, Agile Scrum, and Design Thinking - and came to the conclusion that the Design Thinking approach would be most appropriate. Despite the need for extensive documentation, we found that the Design Thinking approach generated the greatest amount of value for users, which was our goal.

			<h2>Empathise</h2>

			At the beginning of our project, it was imperative that we learned about the users of the Huli information system and mobile application - the forest guards, chief conservators, and the team at headquarters. Our understanding of Huli's users were limited to screenshots of the mobile application, the project scenario, which essentially detailed a day in the lives of a Forest Conservator, and a video explaining the Huli software. Ideally, we would have used these resources to guide multiple interviews with Huli's users but as we were not in contact with them, we interviewed our Lecturer-in-Charge, Sandeep Mysore, who had first-hand experience with the routes.<p>

			<h3>Interviews + Roleplay</h3>
			Through interviewing Sandeep, we were able to better understand what the forest guards do. We asked how routes were chosen, who had a mobile phone and access to the application, how reliable Internet connectivity was (if any), and how familiar the forest guards were with technology. This allowed us to either confirm or remove any assumptions we previously had at the beginning of this project. Bearing these answers in mind, we used roleplay to understand the perspective of forest guards. In particular, we roleplayed the patrol routine to identfiy user touch points, and potential opportunities to streamline these processes.<p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Define</h2>

			To synthesise all the data and information we collected from conducting interviews and roleplaying, we created empathy maps and point of view statements, which assisted us in defining the problem statement.<p>

			<h3>Empathy Maps</h3>
			We created empathy maps to summarise what Huli's users say, think, do, and feel, along with their pain points and what they gain from the entire wildlife conservation experience.

			<h3>Point of View Statements</h3>
			We then created Point of View (POV) statements that formed the basis of our design decisions, assisting us in the ideation stage.

		</div>

		<section>
			<div class="type">Ideate</div>
			Based on our POV statements, we brainstormed as many ideas as possible, regardless of how simple or complex they were. This allowed us to consider all possibilities and build upon any ideas that we personally thought were unsuitable.<p>

			<h2>Prototype & Test</h2>

			When we first started to prototype, we used low-fidelity prototypes to test how certain features would work and whether they would be beneficial to the user experience. We tested these prototypes to build a better user experience, noting pros and cons of each feature or process. We then developed an interactive prototype using prototyping software to better visualise and experience the mobile application. As Huli's users were unable to interact and test the prototypes, we once again had to roleplay the use of the mobile application on routes to test and improve the user experience.<p>
			Our prototype was developed based on the following assumptions:
			<ul>
				<li>Not all user devices have a ‘Back’ button, whether it is physical or virtual</li>
				<li>All user devices will allow application access to GPS, camera, and gallery</li>
				<li>All user devices have enough processing power to run the application</li>
				<li>All users are willing to learn to use and accept the revise application</li>
				<li>All users will download offline maps of the areas they will be observing</li>
				<li>Translators are available and no words will be lost in translation</li>
			</ul>

			Aside from implementing data analytics and the in-built chat system, we upgraded the mobile interface. To avoid confusion and a smoother transition to the upgraded mobile application, we retained many of the existing features and phrases for familiarity. The most notable changes are the reduction of taps needs to input data, through using combo-boxes, along with compacting forms so that the entire form can be seen on the screen.

			<h2>Reflection</h2>

			<h3>Where to next</h3>
			To further improve the user experience, future steps would include:<p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Observing user behaviour</b> - due to the constraints of the project, we were unable to communicate with the actual users. If we were able to observe how Huli was used by its users, we would validate any assumptions made and create an even more user-focused design.</li>
				<li><b>Testing & feedback with more iterations</b> - would allow us to improve on the changes we have made to Huli, and determine if anything needs to be reverted</li>
			</ul> 
		</section>

		<div class="accent" style="padding:4vw 16vw">
			<div class="text" style="left:10px">
				<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
				<b>Five heads are better than one</b><br>
				Collaboration enables a wider variety of ideas and critiques that will make a project more meaningful (and hopefully improve it!)<p>
				<b>Don't stop an idea at the source</b><br>
				Don't limit ideas within a particular scope. You never know how you can build off wild ideas if you don't even hear them.
