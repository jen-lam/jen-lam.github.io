		<span class="overline">The problem</span>
		<h3>Making changes to your order shouldn't be daunting</h3>
		<p>Yet many Woolworths customers face uncertainty when going through this process, often resulting in them abandoning their changes. In 2024, there were over <b>100K</b> calls regarding cancelling or changing an order.</p>
		<p>Every abandoned order amendment is a potential lost sale for the business, and an unhappy customer who will not receive their perfect order. </p>

		<h2>01. Discovery –</h2>
		<h3>Understanding the technical details</h3>
		<p>As this was an unfamiliar space for me, my first goal was to understand how editing orders work from a front and backstage perspective. This process involved reading up on a lot of past discovery, speaking to engineers who previously built the experience, and testing multiple scenarios in production to generate all possible outcomes.</p>
		<p>Through this process, I uncovered some potential bugs - some of which could be quickly fixed and others that required logs put into place to better understand the cause and effect.</p>
		<p>Fundamentally, changes can involve: products, timeslots, delivery addresses or pick up locations - all of which must be done before a specified cut-off time, and follows a very similar process to the existing checkout experience.</p>

		<h3>Understanding how customers feel about changing their order</h3>
		<p>On the surface, it seemed like a simple process as most of it mimicked the existing checkout experience - something customers would have gone through to place their order. However, upon further discovery through interviews and analysis of customer feedback, I identified the following key themes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Unclear process</b>
				<p>When entering a change order flow, customers are essentially thrown back into a normal shopping experience. While this may be familiar, it raised concerns around understanding how checking out would work.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Product availability</b>
				<p>Customers experienced some of their products going out of stock, despite not having made a change yet. Product availability was one of the key drivers to abandon changing an order as sacrificing multiple products for a new one did not make sense to customers.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Timeslot availability</b>
				<p>Customers experienced their reservations expiring, despite being well within the cut-off times. My hypothesis was this involved a technical bug as a new order ID is made each time, meaning a customer was effectively competing with themselves for a timeslot.</p>	
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Losing promos</b>
				<p>Due to system logic, one-time use promo codes were technically already used with the original order, rendering it useless for the changed order and massively increasing the price of the basket, causing customers to abandon their order.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>An elusive experience in the competitor landscape</h3>
		<p>Making changes to an order through a digital experience was quite uncommon in the competitor landscape. Changes are typically not allowed or can be made through calling a support number, neither of which helped with figuring out what was best in class.</p>
		<p>I did however, get the opportunity to speak with our New Zealand counterparts on their experience, which while not as complex or mature as Australia, still yielded some interesting ideas.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Retaining the order ID:</b> By having the same order ID for the original and changed order, it would be less likely to run into the issue of timeslot and product unavailability</li>
			<li><b>Retaining prices:</b> Customers find more value in being able to 'lock in' special prices from different promotional weeks. While gaming the system was identified as a risk for Australia, data suggests the impact is not as big for New Zealand</li>
			<li><b>Only allowing adding / removing items:</b> Only changing items greatly simplifies the process, as stock levels can be more accurate and does not disrupt routing for other stores</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>02. Define –</h2>
		<h3>Workshopping with stakeholders</h3>
		<p>With less than a week to prepare, I was given an opportunity to use our quarterly planning session on anything design related. I thought this was a good opportunity to align with stakeholders, identify opportunities, and ideate on the problem space.</p>

		<h2>03. Develop –</h2>
		<h3>Consolidating ideas and bringing them to life</h3>
		<p>I worked closely with my UI counterpart to ideate on different concepts from the workshop. We went through multiple rounds of feedback with internal stakeholders and other designers to land on concepts we could take into testing.</p>

		<h3>Evaluating usability</h3>
		<p>I faciliated customer sessions to validate a change order index concept, comprehension of financial information, and general expectations around the process.</p>
		<p>Key insights:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Customers tend to read important information about the process the first time, but will skip past it on future shops. This becomes an issue when conditions or processes change</li>			
			<li>Customers were able to easily change their fulfilment method, instructions and timeslot for their order</li>
			<li>Customers find it useful for their cart to differentiate between original and new products, as they can keep track of what has been added</li>
			<li>Customers find it useful to see how much their order total has changed. However, there is a delicate balance between being transparent and providing too much information, as some customers found it overwhelming to see so many numbers when their main goal was to pay the difference</li>
			<li>Customers found it useful to be prompted with items they usually purchase or specials. They see it as a good reminder and also an opportunity to take advantage of current promotions</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Iterating based on insights</h3>
		<p>To provide the optimal experience for customers, iterations were made based on customer and internal stakeholder feedback. In conjunction, I worked closely with the engineers to understand any technical constraints with the designs, and to ensure switching between different views was seamless and not clunky.</p>

			<h5>Change index</h5>
			<p>Guiding customers with what they can change in their order.</p>
			<p>Customers previously found it confusing and overwhelming being thrown back into the shopping experience to make changes to their order. By introducing a centralised change screen with key entry points to change, customers found it much easier and less overwhelming to make changes.</p>
		</div>

			<h5>Persistent banner</h5>
			<p>Making it obvious to customers when they are in change mode. Introducing actions based on which step they are in the journey.</p> 
			<p>Customers appreciated seeing the banner across the journey as it served as a indicator they were still in the change experience, and a reminder for when they need to complete their changes.</p>

			<h5>Cart filters</h5>
			<p>Providing more granularity to changes in their cart.</p>
			<p>Due to how the cart was built, products are not added in reverse chronological order and instead are sorted into categories. Customers previously found it hard to keep track of what they have added as part of their changed order, and introducing filtering made it easier for them to differentiate between original and new items.</p>

			<h5>Change summary</h5>
			<p>Providing a transparent changelog.</p>
			<p>Customers valued the transparency provided through the change summary, as it acted as a form of confirmation ahead of checkout of what changes had been made. In particular, displaying 'Still to pay / To be refunded' made it easier for customers to budget and removed the need to do any calculations.</p>

		<h3>Reflections</h3>
		<p>I'm grateful for this initiative as it meant I had to organise and facilitate my first in-person workshop in a long time (perks of remote working). Keeping 15 stakeholders engaged for an entire day is tiring but rewarding, as it showed how important it is to bring them along on the journey and the benefit of different perspectives.</p>
		<p>While this experience is still being built out, I can already see additional areas of improvement that can be fast-follows. A lot of work can be done in the pre-change journey to encourage customers to use this feature, especially for busy shoppers whose grocery needs are constantly changing.</p>
		<p>I look forward to seeing how this experience evolves to become a powerful tool for customers, as opposed to a daunting experience.</p>
