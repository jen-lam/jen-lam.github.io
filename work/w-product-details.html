			<h2>Overview</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="content">
			<h3>Information is key in evaluating whether a product is suitable or not</h3>
			<p>Yet many potential Everyday Market customers are left uncertain whether a product is suitable, or are unsure of the Everyday Market proposition itself. As such, customers are either abandoning the site for other competitors or accidentally purchase a non-suitable item, both of which result in a cost to the business and its reputation.</p>
			<p>With the exponential growth of online shopping and the continual rise of online marketplaces, <b>communicating complex information effectively is pertinent</b> to keep Everyday Market competitive.</p>

		<h3>Evaluating usability</h3>
		<p>I faciliated customer sessions to validate a change order index concept, comprehension of financial information, and general expectations around the process.</p>
		<p>Key insights:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Customers tend to read important information about the process the first time, but will skip past it on future shops. This becomes an issue when conditions or processes change</li>			
			<li>Customers were able to easily change their fulfilment method, instructions and timeslot for their order</li>
			<li>Customers find it useful for their cart to differentiate between original and new products, as they can keep track of what has been added</li>
			<li>Customers find it useful to see how much their order total has changed. However, there is a delicate balance between being transparent and providing too much information, as some customers found it overwhelming to see so many numbers when their main goal was to pay the difference</li>
			<li>Customers found it useful to be prompted with items they usually purchase or specials. They see it as a good reminder and also an opportunity to take advantage of current promotions</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Iterating based on insights</h3>
		<p>To provide the optimal experience for customers, iterations were made based on customer and internal stakeholder feedback. In conjunction, I worked closely with the engineers to understand any technical constraints with the designs, and to ensure switching between different views was seamless and not clunky.</p>

			<h4>Change index</h4>
			<p>Guiding customers with what they can change in their order.</p>
			<p>Customers previously found it confusing and overwhelming being thrown back into the shopping experience to make changes to their order. By introducing a centralised change screen with key entry points to change, customers found it much easier and less overwhelming to make changes.</p>
		</div>

			<h4>Persistent banner</h4>
			<p>Making it obvious to customers when they are in change mode. Introducing actions based on which step they are in the journey.</p> 
			<p>Customers appreciated seeing the banner across the journey as it served as a indicator they were still in the change experience, and a reminder for when they need to complete their changes.</p>

		<div class="part" style="width: calc(50% - 32px); padding-top: 4vh">
			<h4>Cart filters</h4>
			<p>Providing more granularity to changes in their cart.</p>
			<p>Due to how the cart was built, products are not added in reverse chronological order and instead are sorted into categories. Customers previously found it hard to keep track of what they have added as part of their changed order, and introducing filtering made it easier for them to differentiate between original and new items.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="part" style="width: calc(50% - 32px); padding-top: 4vh">
			<h4>Change summary</h4>
			<p>Providing a transparent changelog.</p>
			<p>Customers valued the transparency provided through the change summary, as it acted as a form of confirmation ahead of checkout of what changes had been made. In particular, displaying 'Still to pay / To be refunded' made it easier for customers to budget and removed the need to do any calculations.</p>

		<h3>Reflections</h3>
		<p>I'm grateful for this initiative as it meant I had to organise and facilitate my first in-person workshop in a long time (perks of remote working). Keeping 15 stakeholders engaged for an entire day is tiring but rewarding, as it showed how important it is to bring them along on the journey and the benefit of different perspectives.</p>
		<p>While this experience is still being built out, I can already see additional areas of improvement that can be fast-follows. A lot of work can be done in the pre-change journey to encourage customers to use this feature, especially for busy shoppers whose grocery needs are constantly changing.</p>
		<p>I look forward to seeing how this experience evolves to become a powerful tool for customers, as opposed to a daunting experience.</p>
