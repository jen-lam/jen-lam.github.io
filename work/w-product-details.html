			<h2>Overview</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="content">
			<h3>Information is key in evaluating whether a product is suitable or not</h3>
			<p>Yet many potential Everyday Market customers are left uncertain whether a product is suitable, or are unsure of the Everyday Market proposition itself. As such, customers are either abandoning the site for other competitors or accidentally purchase a non-suitable item, both of which result in a cost to the business and its reputation.</p>
			<p>With the exponential growth of online shopping and the continual rise of online marketplaces, <b>communicating complex information effectively is pertinent</b> to keep Everyday Market competitive.</p>

			<h3>Everyday Market & Woolworths</h3>
			<p>Everyday Market is Woolworths's marketplace offering, introduced in 2021. A key consideration I had to keep front of mind was that while my remit was Everyday Market, our products used the same template as Woolworths - meaning that any change I made for Everyday Market would impact Woolworths products. As such, much of my work involved redesigning the Woolworths product details page as well.</p>
		</div>


		<div class="content">
			<h3>Auditing the current state</h3>
			<p>As the product details page had not been touched in years, I wanted to understand all the possible components and assets through two tasks.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><b>Documenting the anatomy</b>
					<br>I documented every instance of the gallery, roundels, banners, tile, tags, offers, health information, product information, reviews, and carousel.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>Screenreader audit</b>
					<br>I conducted a screenreader audit to understand how the current page was structured, and what needed to be improved from an accessibility perspective.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</section>

		<div class="content">
			<h3>Understanding customer behaviour</h3>
			<p>Using mixed methods research, I wanted to understand how customers use the product details page.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><b>Customer interviews</b>
					<br>I facilitated interviews with customers to understand how customers use the product details page depending on the type of product, what information was important to them when decision-making, and any immediate gaps that could be identified.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>Top tasks quant</b>
					<br>I worked with our lead quant researcher to launch a Qualtrics survey to 650 customers to help with ranking and prioritising features.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="content">
			<h3>Understanding the landscape</h3>
			<p>To complement the primary research I had conducted, I also wanted to understand best practices and what customers would be familiar with among global standards.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><b>Landscape benchmarking</b>
					<br>I analysed 12 websites that supported online marketplace functionality, which was a mix of online-only and hybrid companies based in Australia, USA, India and Canada. I also analysed 8 online supermarkets across Australia, USA and the UK.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>Best practice analysis</b>
					<br>I leaned on Baymard Institute and Nielsen Norman Group to further understand best practices for product detail pages, to ensure the experience I was creating was intuitive and baseline customer needs, before introducting additional value.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="content">
			<h3>Stakeholder mapping</h3>
			<p>I identified <b>13 teams</b> that either developed, owned or contributed to a component on the product details page across Woolworths and Everyday Market. After reaching out to an SME from each space, I identified which stakeholders were required as part of the feedback process, as opposed to those who were happy to stay informed.</p>
			<p>I worked with my Product Manager to set up a working group that would ensure all relevant stakeholders had the same updates and had a forum to raise any concerns or feedback.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="content">
			<h3>Parity vs bespoke features</h3>
			<p>Following speaking to stakeholders, I generated a 'feature venn' to record what features were required by certain teams and products, and similarities between Woolworths and Everyday Market. At the time, there was a project which also had another set of requirements specific to pharmacy products.</p>
