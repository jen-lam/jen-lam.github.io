		<span class="overline">The problem</span>
		<h3>Self-service means customers shouldn't need to call customer support</h3>
		<p>Yet Woolworths received over <b>345,000 calls</b> in 2024 regarding account and self-service-related problems. While some of these problems can only be solved by human intervention, there is still a massive opportunity make it easier for customers to self-serve. An opportunity in the millions.</p>
		<p>Despite having a large suite of self-service tools and information, Woolworths makes it hard for customers to find and use them, especially in moments of frustration.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<span class="overline">The solution</span>
		<h3>My Account, my way</h3>
		<p>A foundational account hub that provides a seamless, secure, and intuitive experience for management of personal details, preferences, order history, payment and app security, all in one place.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>01. Discovery –</h2>
		<h3>Stakeholder mapping</h3>
		<p>As the More menu / Account is basically free for all to add to, there were a lot of stakeholders to identify and map against a matrix to determine how to involve them. Following a bunch of conversation and digging around, I identified 16 teams that would be impacted by changes to this experience. Stakeholders from these teams would later be engaged depending on their level of impact as part of feedback and roadshow sessions.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Understanding why engagement is low and calls are high</h3>
		<p>Through speaking to customers, analysing Voice of Customer verbatim and support call logs, and conducting a heuristics analysis, it was clear that the app struggles to support customer top tasks, does not enable personalisation, and deviates from familiar patterns resulting in added cognitive load. There were four key problem areas to be addressed:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Poor scannability and findability</b>
				<p>Customers spend additional time trying to find information or features that are relevant for their needs. The More menu has become an ever-growing list of entry points with no structure. Stakeholders view this screen as a way to bring more visibility to their features, but has an opposite effect as more links are added.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Lack of hierarchy and categorisation</b>
				<p>Customers feel overwhelmed and lost scrolling through all the links. The current hierarchy does not reflect how customers use the menu, or the natural groupings of tasks and information.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Disjointed omni-channel experience</b>
				<p>To access account information, customers are pushed into a different, web view experience. It is not immediately obvious how to return to the app, and customers end up continuining their shopping experience in a buggy web view.</p>	
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Inconsistent with global standards</b>
				<p>When looking at competitors, Woolworths lacks key features and personalisation that enrich the customers self-service experience. As customers form expectations from their experiences with other apps, we are making it harder for them to perform simple tasks.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3><i>"I'm struggling to find it. I know it should be in here somewhere but I can't see it. I must be scrolling past it?"</i></h3>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Looking at global adjacents, the account lags behind in key areas and features</h3>
		<p>Opportunity areas identified include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Personalisation:</b> HMW tailor the experience based on past usage and suggest the next best action so that customers face less friction?</li>
			<li><b>Categorisation:</b> HMW group similar information so that we reflect key jobs to be done?</li>
			<li><b>Surfacing value:</b> HMW make value known to customers so that they get the best out of their shop?</li>
			<li><b>Native account management:</b> HMW make it easier to manage account information for customers who prefer to use the app?</li>
			<li><b>Surfacing help and support:</b> HMW make it easier for customers to access support as a last resort?</li>

		<h2>02. Define –</h2>
		<h3>As Woolworths continues to adopt an app-first strategy, there is an opportunity to...</h3>
	</section>

	<div class="module-two">
		<div class="box">
			<b>Increase <s>More</s> Account menu interactions</b>
			<p>By strengthening the brand of More -> Account, creating a place for all things personal and account-related</p>

	<section>
		<h2>03. Develop –</h2>
		<h3>Understanding top tasks & establishing a hierarchy</h3>
		<p>I used two primary methods to determine what customers used the account for, which would later be validated as part of testing.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Analysing Adobe Analytics & FullStory</b>
				<p>To understand current customer behaviour, I leaned on existing data we had in Adobe Analytics for web and app, and FullStory for web. Although this piece of work was purely for app, it was good to cross-reference and also understand whether behaviours were similar between the two platforms.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Card sorting</b>
				<p>As I also looked to introduce new entry points within the account section, card sorting was performed in moderated sessions to better understand how customers grouped features and information.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

	</div>

	<section>
		<h3>Evaluating usability</h3>
		<p>I then worked closely with my UI counterpart to generate different layouts based on the data we had. After a round of feedback with stakeholders, I facilitated customer sessions to validate the information architecture, usability and comprehension of the My account tab.</p>
		<p>Key insights:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Introducing sections to the Account tab improves findability of pages however, further exploration is required to ensure both business and customer needs are balanced</li>			
			<li>Customers expect all their personal information to be found in Account Details, and have formed this familiarity through experiences with other apps and websites</li>
			<li>Customers do not necessarily expect store credits or promo codes within the Account > Wallet section, however seeing them all in one place was perceived as useful</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Reflections</h3>
		<p>I appreciated that this initiative had reliable, existing data to work with and help inform design decisions. I had also previously worked in the authetication space within Woolworths so much of the log in and security work was familiar and I could lean on my technical understanding to make decisions.</p>
		<p>A challenge I had encountered, which is not as common in other spaces in Woolworths, was trying to quantify the value to senior leadership. As a section in the app that does not directly generate revenue or impact sales, it was hard to attach a dollar value and demonstrate that this initiative should be prioritised. I managed to work with Customer Hub and Finance to understand the financial impacts of certain features, which helped with my financial analysis and pitch to stakeholders.</p>
		<p>Ultimately, this initiative was a good opportunity to work more closely with the business, pitch a strategy deck, and get buy in to proceed with building out this experience.</p>
