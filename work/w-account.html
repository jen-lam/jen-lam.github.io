		<span class="overline">The problem</span>
		<h2>Self-service means customers shouldn't need to call customer support</h2>
		<p>Yet Woolworths received over <b>345,000 calls</b> in 2024 regarding account and self-service-related problems. While some of these problems can only be solved by human intervention, there is still a massive opportunity make it easier for customers to self-serve. An opportunity in the millions.</p>
		<p>Despite having a large suite of self-service tools and information, Woolworths makes it hard for customers to find and use them, especially in moments of frustration.</p>

		<span class="overline">Discovery</span>
		<h2>Understanding why engagement is low and calls are high</h2>
		<p>Through speaking to customers, analysing Voice of Customer verbatim and support call logs, and conducting a heuristics analysis, it was clear that the app struggles to support customer top tasks, does not enable personalisation, and deviates from familiar patterns resulting in added cognitive load. There were four key problem areas to be addressed:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Poor scannability and findability</b>
				<p>Customers spend additional time trying to find information or features that are relevant for their needs. The More menu has become an ever-growing list of entry points with no structure. Stakeholders view this screen as a way to bring more visibility to their features, but has an opposite effect as more links are added.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Lack of hierarchy and categorisation</b>
				<p>Customers feel overwhelmed and lost scrolling through all the links. The current hierarchy does not reflect how customers use the menu, or the natural groupings of tasks and information.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Disjointed omni-channel experience</b>
				<p>To access account information, customers are pushed into a different, web view experience. It is not immediately obvious how to return to the app, and customers end up continuining their shopping experience in a buggy web view.</p>	
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Inconsistent with global standards</b>
				<p>When looking at competitors, Woolworths lacks key features and personalisation that enrich the customers self-service experience. As customers form expectations from their experiences with other apps, we are making it harder for them to perform simple tasks.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Understanding top tasks & establishing a hierarchy</h2>
		<p>I used two primary methods to determine what customers used the account for, which would later be validated as part of testing.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Analysing Adobe Analytics & FullStory</b>
				<p>To understand current customer behaviour, I leaned on existing data we had in Adobe Analytics for web and app, and FullStory for web. Although this piece of work was purely for app, it was good to cross-reference and also understand whether behaviours were similar between the two platforms.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Card sorting</b>
				<p>As I also looked to introduce new entry points within the account section, card sorting was performed in moderated sessions to better understand how customers grouped features and information.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
