			<b>What does this mean?</b>
			<p>We are not supporting customer top tasks, not enabling personalisation, and missing out on acquisition opportunities</p>
		</div>

				<div class="box">
			<b>What does this mean?</b>
			<p>We are increasing the cognitive load of customers by deviating from familiar patterns</p>
		</div>

	<div class="module-two">
		<div class="box">
			<b>Poor scannability and findability</b>
			<p>The More menu is an ever-growing list of entry points with no structure. Stakeholders view this screen as a way to bring more visibility to their features, but that is lost as more links are added</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<b>Lack of hierarchy and categorisation</b>
			<p>The current hierarchy does not reflect how customers use the menu, or the natural groupings of tasks and information. Customers are spending unnecessary time trying to find information or features that are relevant for their needs</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">

		<div class="box">
			<b>Disjointed omni-channel experience</b>
			<p>To access account information, customers are pushed into a different, web view experience. It is not immediately obvious how to return to the app, and customers may end up continuining their shopping experience in a buggy web view</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<b>Inconsistent with global standards</b>
			<p>When looking at competitors, Woolworths lacks key features and personalisation that enrich the customers self-service experience. As customers form expectations from their experiences with other apps, we are making it harder for them to perform simple tasks</p>
